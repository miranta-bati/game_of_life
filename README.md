Game of Life:

The world of the game is a 2-dimensional 100x100 array. Each cell can be in a state, "Dead" or "Alive", having exactly 8 neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The following changes can be observed at each time step:

-Every living cell having less than 2 living neighbors dies.

-Every living cell having 2 or 3 living neighbors stays alive.

-Every living cell having more than 3 living neighbors dies.

-Every dead cell having exactly 3 living neighbors comes back to life.

The evolution of the game is determined only by the initial conditions. The player enters the original layout and observes how it evolves.
